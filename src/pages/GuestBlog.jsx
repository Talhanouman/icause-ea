                      Obviously, your topic is probably your cause or your fundraising campaign. But while it’s tempting to tell your audience everything in one go, it’s better to choose one interesting element and tell us all about that. You can always write more blogs to cover everything else!
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       By choosing a specific topic to focus on, you’ll be able to delve deeper into the subject and connect more with your readers.

                  <p>
                    <strong>Write an outline</strong>
                  </p>
                    <p>
                       You might remember this gem from your high school English teacher - make an outline of your piece before you start writing.
                    </p>
                     <p>
                       Having an outline will make sure your blog is clear and concise so that your readers understand your most important points.
                    </p>
                    <p>To write your outline, you first need to decide if your blog is going to be a story, a how-to-guide or something else altogether.</p>
                <p>
                    Once you know the format, you’ll know how to write your outline. For a story, your outline needs to include an intro, beginning, middle, end and a ‘lesson learned’ or the moral of your story. If your blog is a how-to-guide, your outline could include a numbered step-by-step guide or dot points of the key steps to achieve success.
                </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <strong>
                      Speak from the heart
                    </strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     Fundraising is a topic that brings out a lot of passion, so don’t be afraid to share yours. Try not to dwell too much on your writing style, instead write in a style that feels authentic and reflects the way you would talk about your topic to friends and family.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     To make sure your blog is easy to read, stick to the outline you have created, and make sure you only talk about one point per paragraph!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     Once you’ve got everything onto the page, make sure you proofread and spell-check your blog. As well as your computer's spell-check tool, try a tool like Grammarly, which will also suggest if your sentences are too long or if your grammar is missing the mark.
                  </p>
                   <p>
                    The final step is to read your blog out loud. This is a great way to identify anything your brain might have skipped while reading in your head, plus it will help you identify if your information is flowing in the way you intended.

                    The most successful crowdfunding campaigns take their supporters on a journey. Social media is the perfect place to do this – share your campaign and updates on all your social platforms and encourage your supporters to do the same. Make sure you like and comment every time a supporter posts about your campaign and create a unique hashtag so you can easily search for posts about your cause.

                        Find newspaper and television journalists to send it to by searching for similar stories and contacting the journalists that covered them. Alternatively, find the submission details on news outlets’ websites (but this can make your chances of getting covered a bit lower).{" "}

                        Consider using a press release distribution service to get your story picked up. These are paid services and fees vary, so make sure you do your research.

                    Don’t forget – if you’ve pitched yourself to the media, you need to be prepared for the interviews that follow. If you’re fundraising for a person or organisation, make sure you have their permission first as journalists will probably want to talk to them too.

                          This is so important for so many reasons, most of all because it captures the essence of crowdfunding – a community of people coming together to help someone in need. Making your supporters feel appreciated will not only create good vibes but might inspire them to donate again. At the end of your campaign, share photos and videos to show how they’ve helped and the real, life-changing difference that crowdfunding can make.
