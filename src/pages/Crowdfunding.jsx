                        You have the option to share your story
                        through words, images and video.
                         Whichever you choose, 
                         make sure you tell your story authentically,
                          in your own words, 
                          so that your supporters can see your passion. 
                          Crowdfunding campaigns come in all shapes and sizes, 
                          so this will look different for everyone – you might 
                          find humour the best way to communicate your message, 
                          or speaking a heartfelt message might be the best choice for you.

                      <p>
                        When writing your words or video script, it’s important to focus on ‘why’ you’re fundraising, rather than how much or what for – by telling your supporters why the cause is important to you, you’ll be making it important to them too.

Choosing the right images and videos for your campaign can make a real difference to the support you receive by making an emotional connection. The right images can also inspire your supporters to share your campaign on social media, getting you more attention and more funds.

                    Through your iCause portal, you can share updates about your campaign to keep your supporters engaged (and remind them to donate if they haven’t already). Exciting updates will make your campaign even more shareable, and give supporters a reason to post about it on their own social networks. And as you get closer to your fundraising goal, don’t forget to share updates to celebrate with all the people who have helped you get there – that’s what crowdfunding is all about after all.

                    The most successful crowdfunding campaigns take their supporters on a journey. Social media is the perfect place to do this – share your campaign and updates on all your social platforms and encourage your supporters to do the same. Make sure you like and comment every time a supporter posts about your campaign and create a unique hashtag so you can easily search for posts about your cause.

                        Find newspaper and television journalists to send it to by searching for similar stories and contacting the journalists that covered them. Alternatively, find the submission details on news outlets’ websites (but this can make your chances of getting covered a bit lower).{" "}

                        Consider using a press release distribution service to get your story picked up. These are paid services and fees vary, so make sure you do your research.

                    Don’t forget – if you’ve pitched yourself to the media, you need to be prepared for the interviews that follow. If you’re fundraising for a person or organisation, make sure you have their permission first as journalists will probably want to talk to them too.

                          This is so important for so many reasons, most of all because it captures the essence of crowdfunding – a community of people coming together to help someone in need. Making your supporters feel appreciated will not only create good vibes but might inspire them to donate again. At the end of your campaign, share photos and videos to show how they’ve helped and the real, life-changing difference that crowdfunding can make.
